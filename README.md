# envizon - the network visualization tool

<img src="https://evait-security.github.io/envizon/envizon-wide-export-blue.svg" width="400px" />

This tool is designed, developed and supported by evait security. In order to give something back to the security community, we publish our internally used and developed, state of the art network visualization and organization tool, 'envizon'. We hope your feedback will help to improve and hone it even further.

## Usecase

We use envizon for our pentests in order to get an overview of a network and quickly identify the most promising targets.

## Core Features:

+ **Scan** networks with predefined or custom nmap queries
+ **Order** clients with preconfigured or custom groups
+ **Search** through all attributes of clients and create complex linked queries
+ **Get** an overview of your targets during pentests with predefined security labels
+ **Save** and reuse your most used nmap scans
+ **Collaborate** with your team on the project in realtime
+ **Export** selected clients in a text file to connect other tools fast

## How to start?!

To avoid compatibility and dependency issues, and to make it easy to set up, we use Docker. You can build your own images or use prebuilt ones from Docker Hub.

### Using Docker

Docker and Docker Compose are required.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/evait-security/envizon
cd envizon
# Create self-signed certificates:
mkdir .ssl
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout .ssl/localhost.key -out .ssl/localhost.crt
# If you want to use certificates located elsewhere, provide their pathes with SSL_CERT_PATH and SSL_KEY_PATH
# Create a secret, if you have rails installed locally you can just use:
rails secret
# otherwise, use openssl:
openssl rand -hex 64
# this needs to be provided either as an environment variable (SECRET_KEY_BASE), or added in the docker-compose.yml
sudo docker-compose up
```

#### Development

_If, for whatever reason, you want to run the development environment in production, you should probably consider changing the secrets in `config/secrets.yml`, and maybe even manually activate SSL._

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/evait-security/envizon
cd envizon
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up
```

Running tests:
```
docker exec -it envizon_container_name_1 /bin/ash -c 'rails test'
```

### Without Docker

Requires a PostgreSQL server.

Create a database `envizon` with a user `envizon`. Password and socket location can be modified in the `docker-compose.yml`. Your user needs SUPERUSER privileges; otherwise database import (and tests) won't work, because of foreign key constraints: use `ALTER USER user WITH SUPERUSER;`.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/evait-security/envizon
cd envizon
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

You need to create a secret and SSL certificates, as described above.

Then, run it with:

```zsh
bundle exec rails db:setup
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails db:seed
bundle exec rails assets:precompile
RAILS_FORCE_SSL=true RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true SECRET_KEY_BASE=YOUR_SECRET RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails s
```
#### Development

Databases for development and testing are called `envizon_test` and `envizon_development`, with the same requirements as above. Different database names and credentials can be provided via environment variables or directly modified in ```config/database.yml```

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/evait-security/envizon
cd envizon
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rails db:setup
RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rails db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rails db:seed
RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rails s
```

To run the tests:

```
RAILS_ENV=test db:setup
bundle exec rails test
```

### Start with prebuilt images and postgresql docker image

Coming Soonâ„¢

### Set a password

After starting the docker images go to: https://localhost:3000/ (or http://localhost:3000 if not using SSL)

You have to specify a password for your envizon instance. You can change it in the settings interface after logging in.

### Scan interface

The scan interface is divided in two sections. On the left side you can run a new scan with preconfigured parameters or your own nmap fu. You also have the possibility to upload
previously created nmap scans (with the `-oX` parameter).

On the right side you will see your running and finished scans.

### Groups

The group interface is the heart of envizon. You can select, group, order, quick search, global search, move, copy, delete and view your clients. The left side represents the group list. If you click on a group you will get a detailed view in the center of the page with the group content. Each client in a group has a link. By clicking on the IP address you will get a more detailed view on the right side with all attributes, labels, ports and nmap output.

*Most of the buttons and links have tooltips.*

### Global Search

In this section you can search for nearly anything in the database and combine each search parameter with 'AND', 'OR' & 'NOT'.

Perform simple queries for hostname, IP, open ports, etc. or create combined queries like: `hostname contains 'win' AND mac address starts with '0E:5C' OR has port 21 and 22 open`.

## FAQ

API ?!
+ Currently not. We will work on it. Maybe.

Which browsers are supported?
+ Latest Chrome / Chromium / Inox & Firefox / Waterfox.

Why rails?!
+ Wanted to learn ruby. It's cool.

Why so salty on github issue discussion?
+ This is a community project. We are a full time pentesting company and will not go into / care about every open issue that doesn't match our template or guidelines. If you get a rough answer or picture, you probably deserved it.


## What frameworks and tools were used?

+ Ruby on Rails
+ ruby-nmap (https://github.com/sophsec/ruby-nmap)
+ Materialize CSS (http://materializecss.com/)
+ Fontawsome Icons (https://fontawesome.com/)
+ Material Icons (https://material.io/icons/)
+ Many, many helpful gems
